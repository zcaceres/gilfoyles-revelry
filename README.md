# Revere
## A General Purpose Alert System to Play Motivational Anthems and other Sounds When Stuff Happens

Revere exposes a simple RESTapi that triggers sounds. It assumes that the server is connected to a speaker (i.e. your server is a wifi-enabled Arduino or your old laptop!).

> PRs and additional sounds welcome!

### To Use
1. Clone repo
2. ```npm i```
3. ```npm start``` to launch the Express server
4. Send requests to ```localhost:3000/your-preferred-endpoint``` or

#### Available Sounds
| Endpoint      | Sound        
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned |
| col 2 is      | centered      |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |
